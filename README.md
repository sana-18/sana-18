## 🚀 About Me

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an **AI Specialist**, passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge machine learning, deep learning, and real-world applications. Currently pursuing my Master's in IoT and Big Data, I specialize in developing production-ready AI solutions from data preprocessing to model deployment.

### 🔭 I'm currently working on:

- **AI-Powered IoT Solutions**: Researching LLMs and Blockchain for remote IoT device diagnosis with dual supervision.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems**: Developing Transformer-based detection models for IDS industrial applications.
- **MLOps & Edge Deployment**: Optimizing models for edge devices and managing cloud infrastructure.

### 🌱 I'm currently learning:

- **Advanced LLM Applications**: Fine-tuning and deploying large language models for domain-specific tasks.
- **TinyML & Edge AI**: Exploring efficient model deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices.
- **MLOps Best Practices**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines with MLflow and Kubeflow for production ML systems.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Combining AI with blockchain for secure and transparent data systems.

### 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on:

- Open source AI/ML projects.
- IoT and edge solutions with AI integration.
- Research projects at the intersection of AI and domain specific.
